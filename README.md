This project intends to leverage WWCS as a vehicle to increase the resilience and well-being of rural communities in Tajikistan towards the (real) impacts of weather and climate change. The project aims at establishing a national system, which in the early stages is tested locally, as proof of concept, in the district of Lakhsh (formerly Jirgatol). Within an innovation systems approach, consortium partners and local communities in Lakhsh jointly develop tools, methodologies and approaches that are contextually relevant and acceptable; thereby permitting broad uptake geographically (scaling out) and institutionally (scaling up) through an effective policy and regulatory environment. Lakhsh is in particular need for WWCS, accessible enough to establish ‘proof of concept’ and generally representative of a range of vulnerabilities faced within other districts of the republic.

## Solar radiation sensor (TSL2591)
### Darkened foil on transparent casing of TSL2591
As the light sensor TSL2591 is primarily designed for indoor use, it tends to rapidly oversaturate when placed outside in direct sunlight. To be able to measure even outdoors in direct sunlight, a dark transparent foil was placed on the inside of the transparent lid of the casing for the TSL2591 sensor. For this purpose, we used blocking foil for car windows. To find out how many layers of obscuring foil were necessary, the full spectrum measurements were first transformed into a percentage (between 0 and the oversaturated value, which is 37889). Several measurements were then taken with increasing layers of obscuring foil, providing an average percentage of measured solar radiation per number of foil layers.
